# BLAST

This repository contains the R code implementation for the **BLAST algorithm** described in the paper:  
**BLAST: Bayesian Learning via Augmented Source Transfer**.  

## Main Functions
The main functions for implementing the BLAST algorithm for both regression and classification tasks are included in the file:  **`Main Functions for BLAST.R`**. 

In particular, the functions `mu_generate_blast` and `mu_generate_blast_class` output the mean and variance parameters for our estimated distribution.
